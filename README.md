# ProblemSolvingwithDataScience

## 📌 About the Repository

**ProblemSolvingwithDataScience** is a collection of real-world problem-solving projects using data science methodologies.  
The primary focus is on solving problems end-to-end — from problem definition, data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation, to insights and conclusions.

Each project is placed in its own folder, and where applicable, solutions are provided using both **Python** and **R** to showcase versatility in approach.

All notebooks are shared as Google Colab (`.ipynb`) files for Python solutions and `.Rmd` or `.ipynb` (via `IRkernel`) for R solutions.

## 📂 Current Project

### 🔷 Health Insurance Cost Prediction

**Problem Statement:**  
Health insurance companies need reliable ways to estimate individual charges based on personal and health-related factors. Accurately predicting these costs helps in designing fair policies and managing risk effectively.

**Objective:**  
Predict health insurance costs using features like age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, region, and gender through **Linear Regression**.

**Solution Approach:**  
- Problem Understanding & Hypothesis Building  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Preprocessing & Cleaning  
- Feature Engineering  
- Model Building (Linear Regression)  
- Model Evaluation and Interpretation  
- Result Visualization
