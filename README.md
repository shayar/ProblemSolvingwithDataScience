# ProblemSolvingwithDataScience

## 📌 About the Repository

**ProblemSolvingwithDataScience** is a collection of machine learning and data analysis projects, each focused on solving real-world problems through a structured, data-driven approach.  
The core idea of this repository is to demonstrate how data science can be effectively used to understand, analyze, and solve different types of problems — not just by building models, but by following the complete problem-solving cycle from problem definition to actionable insights.

Each project is organized into its own folder, containing well-documented Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`), primarily designed to run on **Google Colab** for ease of use.

## 📂 Current Project

### 🔷 Health Insurance Cost Prediction

**Problem Statement:**  
Health insurance companies need reliable ways to estimate individual charges based on personal and health-related factors. Accurately predicting these costs helps in designing fair policies and managing risk effectively.

**Objective:**  
Predict health insurance costs using features like age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, region, and gender through **Linear Regression**.

**Solution Approach:**  
- Problem Understanding & Hypothesis Building  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Preprocessing & Cleaning  
- Feature Engineering  
- Model Building (Linear Regression)  
- Model Evaluation and Interpretation  
- Result Visualization
