# Health Insurance Cost Prediction

## 📌 Problem Statement

Accurately predicting health insurance costs is a key challenge for insurance companies to ensure fair premium pricing and effective risk assessment.  
This project focuses on building predictive models using demographic and health-related factors such as:

- Age
- Gender
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Number of children
- Smoking status
- Region

Our goal is to understand how these features influence insurance charges and to provide an explainable prediction model.
